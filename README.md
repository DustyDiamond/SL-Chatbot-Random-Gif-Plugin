Chooses a random gif suitable for the current game you play on twitch.  
Simply import `blank.gif` into (SL)OBS and put your gifs in the Gif Folder. For every Game there has to be a different Folder. With command `!getgame` you can read out your current game, the way the script interpretes the game. Take that exact game name to name your folder. Note that for best results every gif should be the same size.
